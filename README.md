## Outwitting the devil (Nappoleon Hill) *(best book i've ever read)*

- Lesson 1: You spend your entire life operating from either fear or    faith.
- Lesson 2: The devil seeks to make us permanent drifters, never getting around to what weâ€™re meant to do in life. 
- Lesson 3: There are    seven principles which help us gain mental, spiritual, and physical freedom.
- Lesson 4: Decide definitely what    you want from life; then create a plan for attaining it and be    willing to sacrifice everything else, if necessary, rather than    accept permanent defeat.
